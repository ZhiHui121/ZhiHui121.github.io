<p>Yes, meditation is one of my main hobbies. I practice it daily in my free time because it helps me stay calm and manage my stress levels. I usually meditate for about 20 minutes in the morning, and I’ve found it really beneficial for my mental wellbeing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Do-you-like-swimming"><a href="#Do-you-like-swimming" class="headerlink" title="Do you like swimming?"></a>Do you like swimming?</h1><blockquote>
<p>Yes, I love swimming. There’s something special about being surrounded by water - it makes me feel peaceful and weightless. When I’m in the pool, I can really relax and forget about my daily stress.</p>

<p>Yes, there’s a memorable phone advertisement from my childhood. It was for a music-enabled mobile phone, which was quite a luxury item back then since phones weren’t as common as they are now. The ad featured a beautiful woman listening to music on the phone. What impressed me most was the melodious background music and the artistic cinematography - the whole aesthetic was so elegant that it stayed with me for years.</p>

<h1 id="Do-you-often-feel-bored"><a href="#Do-you-often-feel-bored" class="headerlink" title="Do you often feel bored?"></a>Do you often feel bored?</h1><blockquote>
<p>Not really. I’m good at entertaining myself, so I rarely feel bored. I particularly enjoy reading all kinds of books, which keeps me occupied during my free time.</p>
