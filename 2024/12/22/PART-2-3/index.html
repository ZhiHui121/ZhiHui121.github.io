<p>I’d like to talk about my job as a mindfulness teacher, which I believe makes a meaningful contribution to society. As a mindfulness instructor, I teach people practical techniques to manage their depression and anxiety through mindfulness-based approaches.</p>
<p>I became interested in this field while studying clinical psychology at university. Upon graduation, I noticed a growing demand for mental health services, particularly stress management, which led me to pursue this career path.</p>
<p>This profession attracts people who are both professionally qualified in psychology and deeply passionate about helping others. Most mindfulness teachers have backgrounds in psychology, counseling, or related fields, and they need to be patient, empathetic, and excellent communicators.</p>
<p>I consider this job particularly valuable to society because it addresses a crucial modern-day challenge. In our fast-paced world, many people struggle with various forms of stress - whether it’s work-related pressure, financial concerns, or general anxiety. What makes this role especially meaningful is that we serve as a bridge, connecting people who are suffering from mental stress with effective, evidence-based coping strategies. Through our work, we help individuals develop long-term skills for maintaining their mental well-being, which ultimately contributes to a healthier, more balanced society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to recommend Kyoto, a captivating city in Japan that I visited about a year ago with my close friend. It’s a city that beautifully preserves traditional Japanese culture while seamlessly blending it with modern life.</p>
<p>What makes Kyoto particularly special is its distinctive architectural style and atmosphere. The streets are lined with traditional machiya houses, which are narrow but exquisitely designed, featuring meticulously maintained mini gardens and an abundance of local plants. The attention to detail in these spaces perfectly reflects Japanese aesthetic principles.</p>
<p>During our visit, we were constantly amazed by the sight of both locals and tourists wearing traditional kimonos, adding to the city’s authentic atmosphere. We actually took the opportunity to rent kimonos ourselves, which are widely available throughout the city, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in Japanese culture.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of our trip was visiting various ancient temples. We were fortunate enough to participate in a traditional ritual ceremony at one of these temples, which was an eye-opening experience for me as it offered a genuine glimpse into Japanese spiritual practices and customs. This unique experience, combined with the city’s overall charm, made it a truly memorable destination that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in experiencing traditional Japanese culture.</p>

<h1 id="3-Describe-a-countryside-that-you-have-been-to"><a href="#3-Describe-a-countryside-that-you-have-been-to" class="headerlink" title="3. Describe a countryside that you have been to."></a>3. Describe a countryside that you have been to.</h1><ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about my great-uncle’s hometown in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing. I visited this rural area during last year’s Chinese New Year celebration with my family, including my parents, two uncles, and several cousins.</p>
<p>The purpose of our visit was deeply rooted in Chinese tradition - during the New Year festival, it’s customary for younger generations to visit their elders and present gifts as a sign of respect and maintaining family bonds. This traditional practice is particularly important in rural areas where family ties remain very strong.</p>
<p>What struck me most about this countryside was how different life is from the city. Each family lives in a spacious courtyard house, which is quite unlike the cramped apartments in urban areas. The layout typically includes a main building surrounded by smaller structures, all enclosed within a traditional Chinese-style yard.</p>
<p>I was deeply impressed by the peaceful atmosphere there. Unlike the constant noise and rush of city life, the countryside offered a sense of freedom and tranquility. You could hear birds singing in the morning, and people seemed to live at a much more relaxed pace. The experience gave me a fresh perspective on what makes a good quality of life - sometimes having more space and less pressure can bring more happiness than urban conveniences.</p>
